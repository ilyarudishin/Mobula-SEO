You were spot on about omnichain being the next evolution. We've seen some major developments in this space:

**Infrastructure that's matured:**
- LayerZero and Axelar have become much more battle-tested
- Wormhole's integration across 20+ chains is getting solid adoption
- Multichain recovery efforts have pushed other cross-chain solutions forward

**The data challenge you mentioned is real though.** I've been building cross-chain analytics tools and the fragmented nature of omnichain liquidity makes tracking incredibly complex. Here's what I've found works:

**For real-time cross-chain data:**
The Graph's new cross-chain subgraphs are helping, but coverage is still patchy. I've had good results combining:
- DefiLlama for protocol-level TVL across chains
- Mobula's API for unified token data (they handle 50+ chains with normalized schemas)
- Direct RPC calls for the most time-sensitive stuff`
